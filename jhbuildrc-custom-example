# All of jhbuild is Python, so there are all sorts of interesting
# things you can do to customize your build with python commands. This
# file is treated like a python __init__ file, so you can do all sorts
# of interesting things in it.

# The URL for repositories can be overridden.

# repos['git.gnome.org'] = 'https://github.com/GNOME/'

# This is how you'd set your developer access to a git repo.

# repos['git.gnome.org'] = 'ssh://username@git.gnome.org/git/'

# Source and installation locations.

_root = os.path.expanduser('~/gtk')
checkoutroot = os.path.join(_root, 'source')
prefix = os.path.join(_root, 'inst')

# You can override tarballdir so that you need download tarballs only once for
# multiple builds. This works just as you'd expect and can save quite
# a bit of time if you're maintaining several trees.

# tarballdir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'Source', 'Download')

# The moduleset can be overridden.

# moduleset.insert(0, os.path.expanduser('/path/to/extra.modules'))
# use_local_modulesets = True

# As can the default modules to build.

# modules = [
#     'meta-gnome-extended-devel-platform',
# ]

# You can skip modules. These three are ones you might want to skip if you don't
# need WebKit (building it takes hours) or e-d-s which requires WebKit.

# skip.append('WebKit')
# skip.append('libcurl')
# skip.append('evolution-data-server')

# You can also put skipped modules back:

# if 'libglade' in skip:
#   skip.remove('libglade')

# Uncomment the following if you're running OSX 10.11 or later and SIP (see
# https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/RuntimeProtections/RuntimeProtections.html)
# causes shell-script build failures. You'll also need to edit those
# shell scripts to change the shebang from /bin/sh to $PREFIX/bin/bash.
# Note that /usr/bin/env bash won't work, because it will also strip
# the DYLD_* and LD_* environment variables!
# Note as well that any installed dependencies must use their full
# paths for their id (use install_name_tool -id to fix). Boost is a
# particular violator of this rule.

# modules.insert(0, 'bash')
# if 'bash' in skip:
#     skip.remove('bash')

# .jhbuildrc has a master function, setup_sdk(target) which sets
# up the build environment. You *must* call it in .jhbuildrc-custom.
#
# Target can be "10.9", "10.10", etc. It sets
# MACOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and the -mmacosx-version-min CFLAG.
#
# From Xcode 7/MacOSX10.11.sdk on Apple has provided a new format
# dylib stub that links with dylibs from earlier versions of MacOS and
# has been tested to work back to 10.6 if MACOS_X_VERSION_MIN is set
# appropriately. Earlier SDKs lack this feature and may or may not
# actually work on MacOS X versions earlier than the SDK's; whether
# they do depends on whether the SDK contains a newer "compatibility
# version" library than the system on which you're attempting to run
# and which is required by your application.
#
# For default operation, set the architecture and SDK for the native machine:

setup_sdk()
# Comment out the previous and uncomment this one to build for all
# systems running Yosemite and later:
# setup_sdk(target='10.10')

setup_debug()
# setup_release()

# Modify the arguments passed to configure:

# module_autogenargs['libcurl'] = '--enable-static'

# or simply add to them:

# append_autogenargs('gjs', '--without-dbus-tests --without-gtk')

# Note that in either case the args will be added *after* the args in
# the module's autogenargs attribute.

# Tell Git to use a different module and branch (not tag!):

# branches['gtk-engines'] = ('gtk-css-engine', 'bzr')

# Or just switch branches

# branches['gjs'] = (None, 'master')

# Tarballs take a whole URL for branches:

# branches['python'] = 'http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/Python-2.6.4.tar.bz2'

# Note that if the module has hash, md5sum, or size attributes and the
# branch download doesn't match, jhbuild will error out. Open a shell,
# untar the tarball yourself, quit the shell, and select "ignore
# error". Don't try this with modules that need patches unless you're
# sure that the updated version doesn't need them.
#
# Change an environment variable:

# append_module_extra_env('gjs', 'CXXFLAGS', '-O0')

# And more...
